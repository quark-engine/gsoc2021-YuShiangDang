Project Mentors: KunYu Chen, JunWei Song

## Introduction
My name is Yu-Shiang Dang. I am a master's student at NKUST, Taiwan. This summer, I have participated in the GSoC project for [The Honeynet Project](https://www.honeynet.org). The main goals of my project are to develop a new rule generation technique and execute Quark Everywhere strategy (make Quark everywhere among security open source projects) for [Quark-Engine](https://github.com/quark-engine/quark-engine).

And here are the milestones in my project.
* Develop a new rule generation technique in [quark-rule-generate](https://github.com/quark-engine/quark-rule-generate)( a sub-repository in Quark )
* Integrate Quark into MobSF
* Improve user experience and fix the issues in Quark-Jadx integration
* Improve user experience and implement Call Graph in Quark-APKLab integration

Here is my project proposal: [New Rule Generation Technique & Make Quark Everywhere Among Security Open Source Projects](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/project/4548131355623424/details/)
